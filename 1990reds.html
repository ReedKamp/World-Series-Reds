                The 1990 Cincinnati Reds were a professional baseball team that played in Major League Baseball (MLB) during the 1990 season. They were a member of the National League (NL) and competed in the NL West division. The team was managed by Lou Piniella and had a successful season, finishing with a record of 91 wins and 71 losses, which was good enough to win the NL West division title. The Reds were known for their strong pitching staff, which included players like Tom Browning, José Rijo, and Danny Jackson, as well as their solid defense and timely hitting. The team was led by several key players, including outfielder Eric Davis, first baseman Hal Morris, and catcher Joe Oliver. The 1990 season was particularly notable for the Reds because they went on to win the World Series, defeating the Oakland Athletics in a best-of-seven series. The Reds won the series four games to none, with José Rijo being named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series for his outstanding pitching performance. The 1990 Cincinnati Reds are remembered as one of the great teams in baseball history, and their World Series victory remains a significant achievement in the franchise's history.
